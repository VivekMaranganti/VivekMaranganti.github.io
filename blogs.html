      The government should have limited jurisdiction over AI development due to the existence of mallicious information throuhout the internet. When individuals try to ask AI for information which can be used for dangerous actions, or mallitious intentions, the government should be able to censor this information. Althouh this restriction would be handled by large, reputable companies such as Google and Microsoft, smaller organisations may not have a reliable system to handle this censoring. For this reason, government enforcement should be present in the limitation of AI, but not more involvement than reasonable censoring policies. All non-mallicious information should not be restricted due to the protection of the freedom of speech in the first amendment
