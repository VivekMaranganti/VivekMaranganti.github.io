	<p>I am making this portfolio because I believe that it will be an important part of my future. On top of developing my skills in CSS and HTML, it allows me to display my accomplishments, projects, and personality to future employers, college admission officers, and more. It is also easy to update in the future, so I will be able to put new projects and accomplishments on this portfolio as time goes on. Due to it's timeless nature, I will be able to use this tool for as long as choose, which is why putting effort into this project is important to me. </p>
