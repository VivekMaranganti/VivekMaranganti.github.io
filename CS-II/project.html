      <h1>CSII ISP</h1>
      <p><b>Concept:</b> We decided to use PyGame to create a simple game, and an AI to play the game. We used PyGame so that the AI would have direct access to the model, rather than having to rely on the view if we used something like Unity. We wanted a simple game so that the AI would have a small number of inputs and be easier to train, so we made a variation of Doodle Jump, called Monkey Jump. The AI took in 5 inputs: The X and Y position of the platform above it, the X and Y position of the platform below it, and the character's upward or downward velocity. We used a genetic algorithm for the AI, which was based on Darwin's Theory of Evolution. It followed the principles of natural selection, where organisms with the most desireable traits were the only ones to move forward. Using the principle, the AI is able to evolve with each generation, and play the game.</p>

      <p><b>Motivation:</b> AI is one of the fastest expanding fields in computer science, and it is becoming more and more important in our lives with each technological development. We thought that getting some exposure to the topic would be helpful for the future.</p>

	<img src="../Assets/PlayerCode" alt="PlayerCode"> 
	<p>This code shows the Player sprite, the sprite's properties, such as gravity(upward/downward velocity) and the players status. Then, there is code related to the AI, such as the inputs, idle timer, and more. There are also functions for player inputs.</p>
	<img src="../Assets/AICode" alt="AICode">
	<p>This code shows the process of creating new generations of AI's. The "genetics" of two AIs are taken and mixed together to create a "child." Then, this new generation of children play the game, and their genetics are mixed together to create another generation.</p>

      <div class="conclusion">
	<p><b>Conclusion:</b> Overall, this project was a great learning experience. This was my first time making a game, and it was much more simple than I expected. After grasping the basic logic of the games, such as upwards and downwards velocity, collisions, player state's, etc., I had an easy time coding the game. Something that I did expect was the time consumption of the AI. Creating the AI was a difficult process as it was my first time trying to make one, and it was extremely challenging to think of the correct logic. I gained exposure to an important skill in this project, and I hope to better my understanding of the concept.</p>
