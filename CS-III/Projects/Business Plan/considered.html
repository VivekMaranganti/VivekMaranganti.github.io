      <p class="choiceNum">Proposal 1</p>
      <a class="choiceLink" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-eldridge/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Restaurant Picker</a>
      <p class="choiceDesc">I considered this proposal because I personally have experienced the problem that this creation solves. Sitting in a car for half an hour, debating on where to eat while no one has any opinions on where to go, is a relatively frequent occurence for me. However, I decided against this idea becuase I wanted to stay away from projects that were very heavy on front-end, since the digital portfolio is already a good source of practice for web development.</p>

      <p class="choiceNum">Proposal 2</p>
      <a class="choiceLink" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/akshay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Drowsieness Detector</a>
      <p class="choiceDesc"> I considered this proposal because I have worked on creating a similar idea in an innovation class. Drowsy driving is a significant cause of motor vehical accidents, and there are multiple solutions to prevent them, so I like finding new innovative ways to make a product like this different or more accessible to others. However, I dicided not to do this one becuase I wanted to expand my knowledge in topics that I havent explored before. Detecting drowsy driving is something that I have reaserched before, and I want to try something new for my ISP.</p>

      <p class="choiceNum"> Proposal 3</p>
      <a class="choiceLink" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-eldridge/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">(no name for product currently)</a>
      <p class="choiceDesc">The first thing that caught my attention was the ammusing description of the activity,however, I think that this product could be used for some good. Healthcare workers have to protect patient medical records and keep them confidential, even when the doctor themself needs to access them. One way that I have noticed this being done are privacy screen protectors, however, they are not completely effective. This product could ensure that noone is peeking in on other's medical records while a medical professional is accessing them. However, I chose not to do this project because I saw some other proposals which were more alluring to me. Althought I am not choosing this proposal, it may become a personal project for me in the future.</p>

      <p class="choiceNum"> Proposal 4</p>
      <a class="choiceLink" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-kulkarni/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Eagle Card</a>
      <p class="choiceDesc">I liked this proposal becuase I have seen ad's for similar products, but there is a lot of potential to improve them. For example, better compatability for IOS, or an app that store the information from the cards instead of being lost. However, I decided against it because IOS compatability would be an annoying process, and an app would be a lot of front-end design, which I would like to avoid for my ISP. As for the actual product, I cannot envision a way that it can be significantly improved from the existing bands, especially in design and hardware.</p>

      <p class="choiceNum"> Proposal 5</p>
      <a class="choiceLink" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/david-ortega/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Mini-Therapy</a>
      <p class="choiceDesc">I considered this proposal because it fit in well with one of my current commitments, Hope Squad. An online therapy would be an important creation, especially with the current rise in the importance of mental health. However, decided to not commit to this proposal becauase I am not qualified or knowledgable enough to create an effective form of online therapy. Learning about the material is always an option, but I have been taught that serious situtations should be left to professional therapists, and it could be difficult to properly refer users in need to those professionals.</p>

      <p class="choiceNum"> Proposal 6</p>
      <a class="choiceLink" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/gautam-narayan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Stock Trading AI</a>
      <p class="choiceDesc">I found this proposal interesting because I have an interest and a basic level of knowledge in stocks. And although there are already many trading AI's, there is a lot of room for improvement, such as taking in a larger amount of inputs, and considering many different indicators. However, I found this proposal less interesting than other ones, since I prefer long term investing over short term trading, which this AI seems to be targeting.</p>

      <p class="choiceNum"> Proposal 7</p>
      <a class="choiceLink" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/kyle-hernandez/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">2d Fighting Game</a>
      <p class="choiceDesc">This proposal caught my attention becuase I have been planning on creating a game, and this would be a good opportunity to do so. However, I do not see how this proposal could succeed as a business. The proposal's description compares this game's concepts to many high-status games, such as Fall Guys, and Sonic, but I do not see a possibility that this game can gain popularity to rival these high-status games in a competitive market.</p>

      <p class="choiceNum"> Proposal 8</p>
      <a class="choiceLink" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/mustafa-shihab/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">MyJob</a>
      <p class="choiceDesc">I considered this proposal because I am a senior, soon to be going into college, and job searching will become a significant part of my like after it. This project would allow me to learn more about applying to jobs, general requirments, and more information regarding getting interview. I decided against this issue because I wanted to avoid a project with a focus on front-end development, since the digital portfolio is already developing abilities regarding it</p>

      <p class="choiceNum"> Proposal 9</p>
      <a class="choiceLink" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/onik-hoque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Shelter Safe</a>
      <p class="choiceDesc">I considered this proposal because we have recently natural disasters - specifically hurricanes - that have damaged countless properties and hurt many people. I found this project to be one that is very fitting for this time of year, since hurricanes and floods will begin to increase. However, I decided not to do this proposal because there are already multipe apps that aid people affected by natural disasters, and many resources for them. I was unable to come up with a way to create this app better than the competitors.</p>

      <p class="choiceNum"> Proposal 10</p>
      <a class="choiceLink" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/vivek-maranganti/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Code Converter</a>
      <p class="choiceDesc">I considered this proposal because I personally have had the desire to convert my python program into swift or C++ during the optimal sorting assignment, but was unable to due to the lack of a reliable program that converts code from one language to another. I decided to commit to this idea because it was easy to do better than competitors, since there aren't many good competitors, and it has a large capability for expansion. This project could be developed to the point where it could be used in significant tech companies to translate large bases of code. Due to the significant room for improvement from competitors, and significant room for development, I want to make the Code Converter my ISP</p>
