	<p>Security is an important part of our lives on the internet, especially when
          considering the extent to which we use the internet for personal and sensitive matters. Due to its
          importance, there are many people who try to intercept and steal personal information, such as usernames and
          passwords. This can be very dangerous for peoples lives, because intruders can get information such as
          bank details, social security numbers, and more.</p>
	<p>This issue was extremely prevalent before HTTPS became
          widespread and accessible - when HTTP was used instead. The use of HTTP invited many types of information
          theft, because anyone could monitor the actions of people on the internet by accessing data that was being
          transported. This was one of the main reason HTTPS was created: to encrypt data between a client and server,
          preserving security and privacy. This is done through the use of third parties called &quot;Certificate
          Authorities,&quot; who sign the security certificates of websites who prove their identities outside of the
          internet. When a browser tries to access a website, the website must use that signed certificate to prove
          that it is legitimate. Also, the use of hashes in these certificates makes them secure. Hashes are complex
          algorithms that process all information that they are given. These hashes increase security because changing
          a single part of the hash can change a large part of the certificate. The widespread use of HTTPS caused a
          period of high security on the internet since HTTPS is so secure that no one is able to break its
          encryption, however, that security was compromised by the use of HTTPS Proxy Appliances.</p>
	<p>Despite the security of HTTPS&#39;s encryption, HTTPS
          Proxy Appliances (can also be referred to as SSL Proxy) can be used to intercept and steal information.
          These proxies work as a &quot;man in the middle&quot; attack, where the data you are passing from your
          browser is received by someone or something in the middle of the data&#39;s transmission. The HTTPS Proxy
          Appliance works in multiple steps. First, it intercepts the encrypted data coming from a user. Then, it
          creates a fake web server certificate, which is signed using a fake signature that was implanted in the
          user&#39;s device itself. Because the web server certificate is signed, the browser cannot tell that it is a
          fraudulent website, and a connection is formed. The users data can then be collected, stored, examined, and
          more. Finally, the HTTPS Proxy Appliance re-encrypts the data and sends it to the proper website.</p>
	<p>Although this SSL interception cannot be prevented, it
          can be reliably detected. This is because of the way that public and private keys interact. A public key
          (provided by the website&#39;s security certificate) can encrypt a user&#39;s data, and the private key
          (secured on a remote server) can decrypt a user&#39;s data. However, a private key can only decrypt data
          from its paired public key. Because of this, the SSL Proxy Application is forced to provide a public key
          that is paired with the private key of the fraudulent website. This means that the public key of the
          fraudulent website can be cross-checked with the public key of the genuine website, and if the public keys
          do not match, the user is connected to a fraudulent website.</p>
	<p>Cross-checking public keys is generally reliable, but
          there can be instances of false positives and false negatives. A false positive usually occurs when testing
          the public key of widespread services, such as Google and Microsoft. Large companies such as these usually
          possess multiple security certificates, so when they are tested, users may get a different public key, even
          though their connection is not being intercepted. A false negative, though it is extremely unlikely, could
          happen when the private key of an SSL interception&#39;s fake website matches the private key of the website
          that the user is trying to connect to. If this happens, the fraudulent public key would match the real
          public key, and your test would show that you are not being intercepted, even if you are.</p>
	<p>One example of a proxy being used to take information is
          GoGuardian. GoGuardian has access to nearly all parts of our browser, and I believe that it is an invasion
          of student privacy. Although it can and should be used legally on school issued devices, enforcing the
          program onto students personal devices through the enforcement of a Google profile pushes the limits of a
          schools-life separation. Although schools should not be able to access the information from a student&#39;s
          personal device, I believe that our government and ISP should have the ability to access these things. Our
          government should be able to access our communications because the ability to create a safe society is more
          important than hiding the meaningless information that we communicate to each other on a daily basis. As for
          an ISP, they are providing the internet to us; so unless it is specified otherwise, they should have the
          ability to access information from their own product.</p>
	<p>Security and privacy have developed greatly due to
          advances in technology, and are continuing to improve. Over time, our methods of security and encryption
          will become stronger, and our personal information will continue to be protected. Although there are some
          entities that go too far with proxies when enforcing regulations and monitoring, proxies can be applied to
          do good as well, and their usage should be monitored and regulated.</p>
